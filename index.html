 <h3>1. KyleXY (Series)</h3>
 <p>
    This was one of my favourite movies of all time and it captured my attention ever since i watched <br>
 the first season in 2008. I was hooked to an extent that when i was indepedent i had to look <br>
 for it and rewatch it. All the 3 seasons. <br> <br>

 <h3>2. Lost (Series) </h3>
 <p>
    Watched my first season way back in 2007, but since it was always brought at school, i never got the <br> 
 chance to watch the whole of it until of recent here in 2023 when i downloaded and watched all the <br> 
 six seasons. Even though its setting was way back in 2002, it is still one of my favourite series todate. <br> <br>

 <h3>3. Madmax Fury Road (Feature)</h3>
 <p>
    Wait a minute, who doesnt love some mad-action movie which keeps you at the edge of your seat as you <br>
 enjoy the unleashed tense of the action. Set way back in 2012, but still an amazing on to go for. <br> <br>

 <h3>4. White Lotus (Series)</h3>
 <p>
    Currently at a 2 season production with prospects for a 3rd season, its an intriging one to watch and i <br>
 cannot hesistate to recommend it to anyone else who is a movie fanatic and a lover of tense and non-predicatble <br>
 series of events where every character has a role to pay and depicts on current events. <br> <br>
